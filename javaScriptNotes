channels for js: programming with mosh, tamil hacks, telusuko
editor, node js , browser
-->js- internal(inside html page using <script> tag) and external (separate js file for code and link the file inside the html file)
-->variables:   to store data or memory address
    var, let -is best to practice, const
    (e.x )let name="Mythili"
   const--  we cannot reassign const value.
 naming rules:
--cannot be reserved keyword (like if,else)
--meaning names(dont use a,b)
-- cannot start with number.
-- first word first letter should be lower case - camel notation(e.x  firstName)

primitive type: we have strings and number and boolean, undefined and null.
 if you don't want to change or reassign ypur variable you can use const.
what is dynamic??
      type of the of the variable can change here.

OBJECT:
object-- it's like object in real world (person, car)
let person={
          name:"kuzhali",      -->this person object properties.
          age: 25
};
person.name="kavin" ---> here we are used dot notation for  changing or accessing properties or read a value. 
console.log(person.name);
Bracket notation-- person['name']= "kavin";
functions-- set of statement that performs a task or calculates  a value.


#js is loosely typed programming language.
#js is dynamically  typed scripting  language.
# getElementById  --->The getElementById() method returns an element with a specified value. The Document method  getElementById() returns an Element object representing the element whose id property matches the specified string. one particular html tag

#getElementByClass-->  but this is for  multiple tags. you can use this.

In form:
events:  onclick,onsubmit,
action- The action attribute specifies where to send the form data when a form is submitted.

Rendering  --> display something on  a webpage.
 
java script frame work
1. rendering => view
2. Data handling => Model
3. Event handling => controller

learn latest framework like react, angular.
